In this project I tried to have Comparison between Different Segmentation Techniques used to detect brain lesion in MR images.
There is a comparison between different segmentation methods. 
In separated files, based on their types, by run the main or test part of code in each part you can see results.
I have used a MS brain lesion data set and placed 3 to for of them here as a test. 
There is also a final folder which I decided to use different segmentation methodes to have a better result.
I used Canny edge detection then morphological technics and then I used Multilevel thresholding(Otsu THreshold) to find lesion part.
